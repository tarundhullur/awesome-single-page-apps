## 🚀 Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this repository page to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a descriptive branch name for your contribution:

git checkout -b add-your-project-name
```

**Example:**

```

### 4. Create Your Project Folder

Create a new folder inside the repository root with a **unique and descriptive name** using `kebab-case`:

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
```

**Good folder names:**

- `weather-dashboard`
- `retro-calculator`
- `memory-card-game`
- `portfolio-website`

**Avoid:**

- `project1` or `myapp` (not descriptive)
- `Weather_App` or `weatherApp` (not kebab-case)

### 5. Add Your Project Files

Place all your project files inside your new folder. **Important**: Each project must include a comprehensive README.md file using our standardized template.

**Required Structure:**

your-project-name/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── README.md           # REQUIRED - Use our template (see below)

**📝 README Requirements:**

- Copy our [README template](./PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md) and fill it out completely
- Include working live demo link
- List all features and technologies used
- Add installation/setup instructions
- Include at least 1 screenshot (recommended)

**✅ Use the Template:**

# Then edit it with your project details
```
