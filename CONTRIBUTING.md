## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before you start, make sure you have:

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this repository page to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a descriptive branch name for your contribution:

git checkout -b add-your-project-name
```

**Example:**

git checkout -b add-weather-dashboard
```

### 4. Create Your Project Folder

Create a new folder inside the repository root with a **unique and descriptive name** using `kebab-case`:

mkdir your-project-name
```

**Good folder names:**

```text
your-project-name/
├── index.html

├── script.js
├── README.md (optional but recommended)
└── assets/ (if you have images, fonts, etc.)
```
